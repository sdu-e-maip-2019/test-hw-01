# Test exercise

To solve this exercise, do the following.

* Clone the repository using a git client (I recommend to use git kraken https://www.gitkraken.com)

* Get access to the files
  * Use git bash (on windows)
  * Open matlab
  * Move to a suitable directory, where you want to work on this exercise
  * Clone the git repository, through the following steps
    * Right click in the "Current Folder" part of the workspace
    * Select "Source Control"
    * Select "Manage files ..."
    * Select "git" as "Source control integration"
    * Enter the path to the git repository in the field "Repository path". 
      * The path is something like "git@github.com:sdu-e-maip-2019/test-hw-01.git" and can be found using the "Clone or download" button on the assignment page (choose clone with ssh).
    * Click "Retrieve"
* Run the unit test in the file "assignment_test.m"
  * Open the file and click on "Run tests" (or press F5).
  * Observe that the test fails
  * Fix the failed tests by modifying the following files
    * add_numbers.m
    * subtract_numbers.m
* Commit the changed files to git
  * Right click in the "Current Folder" part of the workspace
  * Select "Source Control"
  * Select "View and commit changes"
  * Select the files that should be committed and write a commit message about what has been changed.
* Push the changes back to the assignment repository on github.
  * Right click in the "Current Folder" part of the workspace
  * Select "Source Control"
  * Select "Push"
* Check that the solved assignment has been uploaded to github
  * Open the assignment repository on github
  * Check that your changes are visible on the site
